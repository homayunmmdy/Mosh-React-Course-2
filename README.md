### ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This intermediate-level course is focused on advancing core React skills by building scalable, high-performance applications using modern best practices. It continues the video game discovery app built in the beginner course and introduces new layers of complexity through tools like **React Query**, **Zustand**, and **React Router**.

Topics covered include:

* Advanced state management using **reducers**, **context**, and **Zustand**
* Data fetching and caching with **React Query**
* Infinite scrolling implementation
* Routing with **React Router**
* Performance optimization techniques
* Project structure and maintainability
* Clean and professional code practices

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Took This Course

I took this course to **go beyond the fundamentals and gain confidence working with more complex React features** used in real-world applications. It provided me with practical skills in state management and routing, which are essential for developing scalable front-end applications. The techniques learned here now inform how I architect production-ready React apps.
